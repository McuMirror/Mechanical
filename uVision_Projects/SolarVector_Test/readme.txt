SOLAR VECTOR TEST CODE

This is a program that reads the ADCs on a NUCLEO-F103RB, calculates solar vectors using the SolarVector module, and prints them as yaw/pitch angles in degrees over USB UART (9600 baud). This test code is meant to be used with the test setup described in the Solar Vector SOP on the Team Drive.
