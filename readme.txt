MECHANICAL SUBTEAM REPOSITORY

This git repository holds the embedded C code used by the Mechanical subteam of SlugSat year 3. We have made an effort to include our final programs, libraries, and test harnesses so that all our results are reproducible. For more information on how to use the programs check the approrpiate SOPs in the Mechanical subteam folder of the Team Drive.
